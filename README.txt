This software establishes either a hardware serial or software serial connection 
using the right expansion header on the Arduino Esplora (the left connector appears
unused).

ExploraXbeeRemote is a fork of the example EsploraRemote but it uses Serial1 (the
hardware serial pins D0 and D1 which are on the expansion header at Pins 7 and 8.
This is useful for making a wireless esplora controller.
